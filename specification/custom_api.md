Overview
========

Custom API is a simplified interface for end-user queries. It is done in 'reddit' style: a long URL with slashes.

```
# monthly consumer inflation time series for Russia in 2015-2017
# rog is 'rate of growth'
df = pd.read_json("http://mini-kep.herokuapp.com/ru/series/CPI/m/rog/2015/2017")

# get daily oil prices for Brent, same period
df = pd.read_json("http://mini-kep.herokuapp.com/oil/series/BRENT/d/2015/2017") 

```

The intent is to allow:
- intuitive construction of URL for user
- shorter notation than standard database API GET method 
- get similar data for different countries / regions just by changing little part of URL

The data provided by custom API must be readable by ```pd.read_json()```


URL format
==========

```
{domain}/series/{varname}/{freq}/{?suffix}/{?start}/{?end}/{?finaliser} 

   ? - indicates optional parameter
```

We can relax restrictions of suffix and just query ```name:varname_suffix``` without prior checks.

Tokens:         
`{domain}` is reserved, future use: 'all', 'ru', 'oil', 'ru:bank', 'ru:77'

`{varname}` is GDP, GOODS_EXPORT, BRENT (capital letters with underscores)

`{freq}` is any of:
    a (annual)
    q (quarterly)
    m (monthly)
    w (weekly)
    d (daily)

`{?suffix}` may be: 
    unit of measurement (unit):
        example: bln_rub, bln_usd, tkm
        
    rate of change for real variable (rate):
        rog - change to previous period
        yoy - change to year ago
        base - base index
        
    aggregation command (agg): 
        eop - end of period
        avg - average


Examples:
```
oil/series/BRENT/m/eop/2015/2017/csv
ru/series/EXPORT_GOODS/m/bln_rub
```

Functionality
=============

#### 1. Translate URL

Custom API must translate long url into parameters to database API GET call. Done at:
   - <https://github.com/mini-kep/frontend-app/blob/master/apps/views/time_series.py>
   - <https://github.com/mini-kep/helpers/blob/master/custom_api.py> (newer)

#### 2. Provide pandas-readable data

Database GET method currently returns a json with a list of datapoints, and this data should be converted
into json readable by ```pd.read_json()```.

Such conversion is done at <https://github.com/mini-kep/intro/blob/master/pipeline/pipeline.py> .


Implementation 
===============

1. Custom API design was originally discussed [here](https://github.com/mini-kep/frontend-app/issues/8) and [here](https://github.com/mini-kep/intro/issues/12).
   The result of the discussion is url format above. In discussion there are certain extras for future features.

2. Initial version of custom API is implemented as a part of fronetnd app at <https://github.com/mini-kep/frontend-app/blob/master/apps/views/time_series.py>. It is responsible for translating URLs into parameter dictionaries. Try and click: 
   - <http://mini-kep.herokuapp.com/ru/series/CPI/m/rog/2017>
   - <http://mini-kep.herokuapp.com/oil/series/BRENT/d/2000/2005>
 
3. New implemtation of URL translation is at <https://github.com/mini-kep/helpers/issues/3>  
   and <https://github.com/mini-kep/helpers/blob/master/custom_api.py>.
   
4. We do not have conversion of existing GET output to pandas-readable format yet. May consult prototype at 
   <https://github.com/mini-kep/intro/blob/master/pipeline/pipeline.py> on how this may be done.
   
   
Uncertainties 
=============

- ```<domain>``` may conflict with some API prefixes
- custom API should migrate to ```db``` instead of ```frontend-app```   


TODO
====

- [ ] in database we need a GET method to provide pandas-readable json
- [ ] newer url decomposition
- [ ] mount endpoint at frontend app (?)
- [ ] mount endpoint at db app (?)
- [ ] testing
