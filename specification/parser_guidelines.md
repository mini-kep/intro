==================
Parsers in ```mini-kep``` are used to fetch data from various sources as RAW data in Json, XML and csv formats, parse those data and yield them in common formated output.

Introduction
------------
Parsers gudelines provide detailed information how parsers are constructed. This guidelines should provide manual to speed up new parses development

Checklist
---------
1. Define Source
2. Fetch RAW content from source
3. Parse fetched content
4. Yield content in desired format

Define Source
-------------
When defining source for fetching raw data, one needs to take into consideration as part of URL construction, timeframe or frequency often needs to be incorporated.

- CSV : Pandas, Numpy
- JSON : json

utilities to format dates and prices are available in ```parsers/getter/util.py``` > ```format_date()``` and ```format_value()```

Yield content in desired format
