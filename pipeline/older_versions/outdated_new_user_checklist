Suggested checklist for new users/project contributors:

1. read [intro](https://github.com/mini-kep/intro) and [specification](https://github.com/mini-kep/intro/blob/master/specification/README.md)
2. visit [St Louis FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)
3. try download three pandas dataframes from <http://mini-kep.herokuapp.com/>
5. read [testing guidelines](https://github.com/mini-kep/intro/wiki/Testing-guidelines)

Explore which area interests you most:
- data parsing (read source and provide clean output) 
- parsers dispatching / scheduling
- database (store parser outputs)
- frontend (creating end-user API and flask app)
- using data to solve economic problems (making end-user examples)

Consider if you see yourself in:
- doing some isolated specific tasks in project (easier)
- maintening some part of project (harder)
