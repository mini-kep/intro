Critical path
-------------

0. db api with csv output -> use cases

1. parser specification -> more data -> richer use cases

2. use cases discussion / dessemination



  
Advanced usage
--------------

Services based on mini-kep API: 

- PDF handout charts  
- datasets/presets
- forcasts as a service (via API)
- FB posts with data
