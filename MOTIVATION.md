Motivation
===========
 
Why another database for macroeconomic data? *(If you built  it, you know it.)*
 
- Machine-readable datafeeds for economic data are growing ([FRED](https://research.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/), 
  [quandl](https://blog.quandl.com/api-for-economic-data), 
  [OECD](https://data.oecd.org/api), 
  [World Bank](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/topics/125589), 
  [EIA](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/)).

- However, some data is still left in the dark. Russian macroeconomic statistics seems very 
  fragmented (HTML, Word, Excel are common dessimination formats). 
  This is a roadblock to reproducible analysis as dirty data escalates costs of model maintenance.      

- ```mini-kep``` aims to remove this roadblock by providing 
  [public API for Russian macroeconomic data](http://mini-kep.herokuapp.com/) 
  and examples of economic research/business planning/marketing problems 
  solved in python pandas or R.
